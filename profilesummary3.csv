Question,Answer
Hello whwre is my last meeting,"I can help you with that. AZMTH is designed to help people live more efficiently by tracking daily activities, extracting key information, and scheduling meetings. It also provides a 24/7 available AI personal assistant, organizes ""To-Do"" and ""Notes"" sections, and reminds users in a timely manner.

Unfortunately, I don't have access to your personal data or AZMTH account information. However, if you have AZMTH installed, you can try the following:

1. Open AZMTH and navigate to the ""Meetings"" or ""Calendar"" section.
2. Check if your last meeting is listed there.
3. If you can't find it, try searching for the meeting details or the name of the meeting.

If you're still unable to find your last meeting, you can try contacting the AZMTH support team for assistance. They may be able to help you retrieve the information you're looking for."
