User introduction: Hello Azmat. 

The user plans to integrate AZMTH's extracted todos and notes into their existing workflow, but they do not specify which platform (e.g., Trello, Asana, or Evernote) they will use. 

However, they do not provide a clear answer to how they will handle ambiguous or context-dependent language in the extracted data, such as idioms or sarcasm, that may require additional clarification or human judgment.
